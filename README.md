# Setting Up OAuth Application on MiniOrange


**Prerequisites:**

**🐘 1. PHP 8.1 or above:** 
The php connector uses modern PHP features, including Enums, which are supported starting from PHP 8.1. Ensure your server runs PHP 8.1 or higher.

**🌐 2. Local Server Environment:** 
A local server environment is required to host and run the application. You can use one of the following:
- XAMPP (recommended for Windows users): [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- WAMP: [Download WAMP](https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/)
Alternatively, any other web server setup compatible with PHP 8.1+.

**📦 3. Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP):** 
The application uses Composer to manage dependencies. Ensure Composer is installed on your system.

## 5. Start Your Server 🌐
&nbsp;1. Using XAMPP or WAMP Locally

* Launch the server software (e.g., XAMPP or WAMP).
* Ensure Apache or an equivalent web server is running.

## 6.  Open the Starter App in the Browser** 🌟

* Open a web browser and enter the URL to access your application:
* For your  local environment go to http://localhost/your-folder-name/ to access the starter application.
[Also make sure to update dashboard Url in your-folder-name/oauth.php at line 40 with your-folder-name/dashboard.php]


## 7. Start and Test Authorization** ✅

&nbsp;1. initiate the authorization process by clicking the "Start Authorization" button in the starter app. 

&nbsp;2. This should redirect you to the authentication provider (MiniOrange) to complete the login.

&nbsp;3. After a successful login, you should be redirected back to your application, where you can verify the OAuth flow and ensure your user is authenticated.
