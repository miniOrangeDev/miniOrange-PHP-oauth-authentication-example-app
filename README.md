# Setting Up OAuth Application on MiniOrange


**Prerequisites:**

**üêò 1. PHP 8.1 or above:** 
The php connector uses modern PHP features, including Enums, which are supported starting from PHP 8.1. Ensure your server runs PHP 8.1 or higher.

**üåê 2. Local Server Environment:** 
A local server environment is required to host and run the application. You can use one of the following:
- XAMPP (recommended for Windows users): [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- WAMP: [Download WAMP](https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/)
Alternatively, any other web server setup compatible with PHP 8.1+.

**üì¶ 3. Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP):** 
The application uses Composer to manage dependencies. Ensure Composer is installed on your system.
